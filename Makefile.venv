#
# SEAMLESSLY MANAGE PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WITH A MAKEFILE
#
# https://github.com/sio/Makefile.venv             v2020.08.14
#
#
# Insert `include Makefile.venv` at the bottom of your Makefile to enable these
# rules.
#
# When writing your Makefile use '$(VENV)/python' to refer to the Python
# interpreter within virtual environment and '$(VENV)/executablename' for any
# other executable in venv.
#
# This Makefile provides the following targets:
#   venv
#       Use this as a dependency for any target that requires virtual
#       environment to be created and configured
#   python, ipython
#       Use these to launch interactive Python shell within virtual environment
#   shell, bash, zsh
#   	Launch interactive command line shell. "shell" target launches the
#   	default shell Makefile executes its rules in (usually /bin/sh).
#   	"bash" and "zsh" can be used to refer to the specific desired shell.
#   show-venv
#       Show versions of Python and pip, and the path to the virtual environment
#   clean-venv
#       Remove virtual environment
#   $(VENV)/executable_name
#   	Install `executable_name` with pip. Only packages with names matching
#   	the name of the corresponding executable are supported.
#   	Use this as a lightweight mechanism for development dependencies
#   	tracking. E.g. for one-off tools that are not required in every
#   	developer's environment, therefore are not included into
#   	requirements.txt or setup.py.
#   	Note:
#   		Rules using such target or dependency MUST be defined below
#   		`include` directive to make use of correct $(VENV) value.
#   	Example:
#   		codestyle: $(VENV)/pyflakes
#   			$(VENV)/pyflakes .
#   	See `ipython` target below for another example.
#
# This Makefile can be configured via following variables:
#   PY
#       Command name for system Python interpreter. It is used only initialy to
#       create the virtual environment
#       Default: python3
#   REQUIREMENTS_TXT
#       Space separated list of paths to requirements.txt files.
#       Paths are resolved relative to current working directory.
#       Default: requirements.txt
#   WORKDIR
#       Parent directory for the virtual environment.
#       Default: current working directory.
#   VENVDIR
#   	Python virtual environment directory.
#   	Default: $(WORKDIR)/.venv
#
# This Makefile was written for GNU Make and may not work with other make
# implementations.
