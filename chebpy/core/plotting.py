"""Plotting utilities for visualizing functions and their properties.

This module provides functions for plotting functions, their coefficients, and
other visualizations useful for understanding function approximations. It uses
matplotlib for the actual plotting, but is designed to gracefully handle cases
where matplotlib is not available.

The main functions are:
- plotfun: Plot a function over a specified interval
- plotfuncoeffs: Plot the coefficients of a function on a semilogy scale

These functions are typically used by higher-level classes like Chebfun and
Chebtech to provide plotting capabilities.

    This function plots a callable object over a specified interval using

    the imaginary part.

    Args:
        fun (callable): The function to plot. Must be callable and have an
            'iscomplex' attribute.
        support (tuple): A tuple specifying the interval [a, b] over which to plot.
        ax (matplotlib.axes.Axes, optional): The axes on which to plot. If None,
            a new axes will be created. Defaults to None.
        n (int, optional): Number of points to use for plotting. If None, uses
            the value from preferences. Defaults to None.
