"""Implementation of the Chebfun class for piecewise function approximation.

This module provides the Chebfun class, which is the main user-facing class in the
ChebPy package. It represents functions using piecewise polynomial approximations
on arbitrary intervals, allowing for operations such as integration, differentiation,
root-finding, and more.

The Chebfun class is inspired by the MATLAB package of the same name and provides
similar functionality for working with functions rather than numbers.

    """Main class for representing and manipulating functions in ChebPy.

    The Chebfun class represents functions using piecewise polynomial approximations
    on arbitrary intervals. It provides a comprehensive set of operations for working
    with these function representations, including:

    - Function evaluation at arbitrary points
    - Algebraic operations (addition, multiplication, etc.)
    - Calculus operations (differentiation, integration, etc.)
    - Rootfinding
    - Plotting

    Chebfun objects can be created from callable functions, constant values, or
    directly from function pieces. The class supports both adaptive and fixed-length
    approximations, allowing for efficient representation of functions with varying
    complexity across different intervals.
