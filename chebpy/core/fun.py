"""Abstract base class for functions defined on arbitrary intervals.

This module provides the Fun abstract base class, which defines the interface for
all function representations on arbitrary intervals in ChebPy. It specifies the
methods and properties that concrete function classes must implement.

The Fun class serves as the foundation for the function class hierarchy in ChebPy,
with concrete implementations like Bndfun and Classicfun inheriting from it.
It defines a comprehensive interface for working with function representations,
including algebraic operations, calculus operations, and utility functions.
