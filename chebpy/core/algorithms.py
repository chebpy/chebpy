"""Numerical algorithms for Chebyshev approximation and manipulation.

This module provides core numerical algorithms used throughout the ChebPy package,
including rootfinding, barycentric interpolation, Chebyshev coefficient manipulation,
and adaptive approximation techniques.

The algorithms implemented here are based on established numerical methods for
working with Chebyshev polynomials and approximations, many of which are described
in Trefethen's "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice".
