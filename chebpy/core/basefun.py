"""Abstract base class for functions in ChebPy.

This module provides the BaseFun abstract base class, which defines the interface for
all function representations in ChebPy. It specifies the methods and properties that
concrete function classes must implement.

The BaseFun class serves as the foundation for the function class hierarchy in ChebPy,
with concrete implementations inheriting from it. It defines a comprehensive interface
for working with function representations, including algebraic operations, calculus
operations, and utility functions.

This class replaces the previous separate Fun and Onefun classes, merging their
functionality into a single base class.
