"""Core functionality for the ChebPy package.

This package contains the core classes and functions that implement the ChebPy
functionality. It includes the fundamental data structures for representing functions,
algorithms for numerical operations, and utilities for working with these objects.

The core package is organized into several modules:
- chebfun: Implements the main Chebfun class for representing functions
- bndfun: Implements functions on bounded intervals
- chebtech: Implements Chebyshev technology for approximating functions
- algorithms: Numerical algorithms used throughout the package
- utilities: Helper functions and classes
