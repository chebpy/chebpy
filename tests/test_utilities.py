    This test verifies that the union method raises a SupportMismatch exception
    when attempting to union domains with different supports. It checks:
    1. Attempting to union domains with different right endpoints raises SupportMismatch
    2. The exception is raised regardless of the order of the domains

    The test ensures that the method correctly validates its inputs and
    provides appropriate error messages when the operation cannot be performed.
