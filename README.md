**🔬 Numerical computing with Chebyshev series approximations in Python**

*ChebPy enables symbolic-numeric computation with functions, not just numbers*

</div>

ChebPy is a Python implementation of [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/), bringing the power of Chebyshev polynomial approximations to Python. It allows you to work with functions as first-class objects, performing operations like differentiation, integration, and root-finding with machine precision.

make test

# ✨ Format and lint code
make fmt
make lint

# 📓 Start interactive notebooks
make marimo

# 🔍 View test coverage report
make coverage
```

### Development Tools

- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting
- **Formatting**: ruff for code formatting and linting
- **Notebooks**: marimo for interactive development
- **Task Management**: Taskfile for build automation

## Quick Start

This figure was generated with the following simple ChebPy code:

```python
import numpy as np
from chebpy import chebfun

# Create functions as chebfuns on interval [0, 10]
f = chebfun(lambda x: np.sin(x**2) + np.sin(x)**2, [0, 10])
g = chebfun(lambda x: np.exp(-(x-5)**2/10), [0, 10])

# Find intersection points
roots = (f - g).roots()

# Plot both functions and mark intersections
ax = f.plot(label='f(x) = sin(x²) + sin²(x)')
g.plot(ax=ax, label='g(x) = exp(-(x-5)²/10)')
ax.plot(roots, f(roots), 'ro', markersize=8, label='Intersections')
ax.legend()
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
```

### More Examples

```python
# Differentiation and integration
f = chebfun(lambda x: np.exp(x) * np.sin(x), [-1, 1])
df_dx = f.diff()          # Derivative
integral = f.sum()        # Definite integral

# Root finding
g = chebfun(lambda x: x**3 - 2*x - 5, [-3, 3])
roots = g.roots()         # All roots in the domain

# Function composition
h = f + g                 # Addition
product = f * g           # Multiplication
```
