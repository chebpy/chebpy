# Workflow: Marimo Notebooks
#
# Purpose: This workflow discovers and executes all Marimo notebooks in the
#          repository. It builds a dynamic matrix to run each notebook in
#          parallel to surface errors early and keep notebooks reproducible.
#
# Trigger: This workflow runs on every push and on pull requests to main/master
#          branches (including from forks)
#
# Components:
#   - 🔎 Discover notebooks in book/marimo
#   - 🧪 Run each notebook in parallel using a matrix strategy
#   - ✅ Fail-fast disabled to report all failing notebooks
