# Workflow: Deptry
#
# Purpose: This workflow identifies missing and obsolete dependencies in the project.
#          It helps maintain a clean dependency tree by detecting unused packages and
#          implicit dependencies that should be explicitly declared.
#
# Trigger: This workflow runs on every push and on pull requests to main/master
#          branches (including from forks)

        # NOTE: make deptry is good style because it encapsulates the folders to check
        # (e.g. src and book/marimo) and keeps CI in sync with local development.
        # Since we use a 'uv' container, the Makefile is optimised to use the
        # pre-installed 'uv' and 'uvx' from the system PATH.
