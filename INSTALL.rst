User Installation
-----------------

The most convenient way to get going is to run::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/chebpy/chebpy.git
    
This can also be run from the Anaconda prompt in case you are running Anaconda. The above has been tested from both Windows and Linux (and requires `git <https://git-scm.com>`_).

To update chebpy from source, run::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/chebpy/chebpy.git -U

Contributor Installation
------------------------

Find a suitable location on your machine and run::

    $ git clone https://github.com/chebpy/chebpy.git

Adding the outer chebpy folder to a PYTHONPATH environment variable is then one way to proceed.
